# I Want Coffee
If you want coffee as soon as possible, this is the app for you. Simply open the app and see the closest coffee shops closest to you right now.

Note: If you're trying to build the app with Xcode, you need to replace `kFSClientID` and `kFSClientSecret` in IWCDataController.m with your own from the Foursquare API.
